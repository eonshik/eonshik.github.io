# Portfolio Website

For this project, I will build a personal portfolio site, a static website where I can share the projects that I build in this Path. Typically, a portfolio website will have a main page that features different projects that Iâ€™ve built and another page that contains contact information, in case someone wants to reach out to you. Occasionally, there are additional pages for each project, detailing the technology used.
